       " 'If you run out of your Curology products early, you can request to move your next delivery up sooner and vice versa should you need more time to make your way through your current products and push out the next shipment.',\n",
       " 'It’s worth noting that due to Curology’s unique model, they bill their customers directly and do not accept insurance. That said, you may be able to pay directly with your HSA or FSA card. If you have questions about whether or not Curology may be a covered expense by one of these plans, it’s best to contact your plan administrator.',\n",
       " 'If you’ve never introduced Curology’s list of ingredients to your skin before, you may see your skin go through a “purge” prior to witnessing results. This means that you may experience a temporary acne flare due to your pores getting cleaned out. That said, some people may not experience this at all. It is also possible that you may notice some redness and irritation as your skin adjusts to your new topical prescription formula. Your Curology provider is there if you have any questions about this and can offer tips to help you adjust.',\n",

       " 'While ultimately results will vary from person to person, my personal experience has been highly positive since I began my Curology journey a few weeks ago. I was surprised to see my skin adjust quickly to the Custom FormulaRx I was prescribed through my trial box, which included tretinoin, clindamycin phosphate, and azelaic acid, all of which were entirely new ingredients to me.',\n",
       " 'My provider started me out on lower strengths of tretinoin and azelaic acid, therefore my skin was able to adapt with minimal negative side-effects. While I did experience a few more breakouts than usual in the beginning, I saw my skin texture begin to even out and my complexion appear brighter overall pretty quickly. I also credit these benefits to my use of the cleanser, moisturizer, and Micellar Makeup Remover.',\n",
       " 'Like most skincare products, it can take up to a few months for noticeable changes to manifest across my skin. According to Curlogy, many consistent-use patients will notice a difference within 6 to 8 weeks of application.
