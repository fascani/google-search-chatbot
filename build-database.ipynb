If you have questions about whether or not Curology may be a covered expense by one of these plans, it’s best to contact your plan administrator.',\n",

This means that you may experience a temporary acne flare due to your pores getting cleaned out. That said, some people may not experience this at all. It is also possible that you may notice some redness and irritation as your skin adjusts to your new topical prescription formula.

I was surprised to see my skin adjust quickly to the Custom FormulaRx I was prescribed through my trial box, which included tretinoin, clindamycin phosphate, and azelaic acid, all of which were entirely new ingredients to me.',\n",
       " 'My provider started me out on lower strengths of tretinoin and azelaic acid, therefore my skin was able to adapt with minimal negative side-effects. While I did experience a few more breakouts than usual in the beginning, I saw my skin texture begin to even out and my complexion appear brighter overall pretty quickly. I also credit these benefits to my use of the cleanser, moisturizer, and Micellar Makeup Remover.',\n",
